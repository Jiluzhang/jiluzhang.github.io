#### 1. What is A/B Testing?

- A/B testing is a method of comparing two version of a webpage or app against each other to determin which one performs better. A/B testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.



#### 2. How A/B Testing works?

- In an A/B test, you take a webpage or app screen and modify it to create a second version of the same page. Then, half of your traffic is shown the original version of the page (known as **the control**) and half are shown the modified version of the page (**the variation**).
- As visitors are served either the control or variation, their engagement with each experience is measured and collected in an analytics dashboard and analyzed through a statistical engine. You can then dermine whether changing the experience had a positive, negative, or no effect on visitor behavior.



#### 3. Why we need to do A/B Testing?

- A/B testing allows individuals, teams, and companies to make careful changes to their user experiences while collecting data on the results. This allows them to construct hypotheses, and to learn better why certain elements of their experiences impact user behavior.
- A/B testing can be used consistently to continually improve a given experience, improving a single goal like conversion rate over time.
- A/B testing can also be used by product developers and designers to demonstrate the impact of new features or changes to a user experience.



#### 4. Describe the process to perform an A/B Testing.

- **Collect Data**: Look for pages with low conversion rates or high drop-off rates that can be improved.
- **Identify Goals**: Your conversion goals are the metrics that you are using to determine whether or not the variation is more successful than the original version.
- **Generate Hypothesis**: Make the hypothesis for the plan you think it will improve the webpage.
- **Create Variations**: Make the desired changes to an element of your website or mobile app experience.
- **Run Experiment**: Kick off your experiment and wait for visitors to participate! At this point, visitors to your site or app will be randomly assigned to either the control or variation of your experience. Their interaction with ech experience is measured, counted, and compared to determin how each performs.
- **Analyze Results**
